# Callback service

A call centre exists, when the user provides their phone number and the
time they would like to be called back they will be called back.

The call centre can only call back if it's open which is:
 * Mon - 9-5
 * Tues - 9-5
 * Weds - 9-12
 * Thurs -9-5
 * Fri - 9-5

The call centre needs two hours notice before making the call.

The call centre doesn't accept calls more than 6 working days away.

Write some code which accepts a requested callback time and returns whether
the requested time is valid.
